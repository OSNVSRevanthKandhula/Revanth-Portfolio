            <h2>Python Programming</h2>
            <p>I have foundational knowledge of Python programming and have applied it in simple, logic-based projects such as a calculator application. Working with Python improved my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and understanding of control structures, loops, and basic program flow.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card"> 
            <h2>Front-End web Development</h2>
            <p>I have practical experience in front-end web development using HTML and CSS. I designed and developed a responsive personal portfolio website with a clean and user-friendly layout. This skill allows me to structure content effectively, apply modern styling, and present information in a clear and professional manner.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>CAD Design (CATIA & AutoCAD)</h2>
            <p>I am skilled in using CAD tools such as CATIA and AutoCAD for 2D drafting and 3D modeling of mechanical components. I have designed parts with a focus on dimensional accuracy, manufacturability, and design intent. These tools have helped me translate conceptual ideas into precise engineering drawings and models.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Engineering Analysis (ANSYS)</h2>
            <p>I have basic experience in performing design analysis using ANSYS, where I analyzed stress distribution and structural behavior of mechanical components. This helped me understand how design decisions affect performance and safety, and improved my ability to validate designs through analytical methods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>CNC Machining & Workshop Practices</h2>
            <p>Through industrial training at IGIAT, I gained hands-on exposure to CNC machining, milling, and lathe operations. I learned the fundamentals of machine setup, tool usage, and machining processes, which enhanced my understanding of real-world manufacturing and precision engineering.</p>
