                <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
                <p>I designed and developed a responsive personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS to showcase my educational background, technical skills, and projects in a clean and user-friendly layout. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of web page structure, styling, responsive design principles, and best practices for presenting professional information online.</p>

            <div class="card" id="project">
                <h2>Python-Based Calculator Application</h2>
                <p>I developed a simple console-based calculator application using Python that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project improved my programming logic, understanding of control structures, and ability to write clean, functional code for practical problem-solving.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card" id="project">
                <h2>Design & Analysis of a CNC Machine Component</h2>
                <p>I designed a CNC milling machine component using CATIA V5 and performed structural analysis using ANSYS to study stress distribution and component behavior under load conditions. This project enhanced my understanding of design validation, engineering analysis, and the relationship between design decisions and performance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card" id="project">
                <h2>3D Printed Prototype of a Mechanical Gear System</h2>
                <p>I designed a functional mechanical gear system using TinkerCAD and successfully produced a physical prototype through 3D printing. This project provided hands-on experience in digital modeling, rapid prototyping, and converting virtual designs into real-world components.</p>
